### Added

- Insights page with savings detectors that attach dollar estimates: low cache hit rate, premium models on short sessions, compaction thrash, and subscription plan fit.
- Monthly budget (stored in `~/.cc-lens/config.json`) with pacing projection, plus daily spend spike detection surfaced on Insights and Costs.
- Team feature adoption view: per-member use of plan mode, agents, skills, MCP, and web, with cost per session and idle badges.
- MCP server governance inventory on the Team page, built from tool counts already present in redacted exports.
- `cc-lens digest` command that posts a summary (spend, top projects or members, savings, budget pace, spike alerts) to a Slack incoming webhook; supports `--team` and `--dry-run`.
- Wrapped page: a yearly shareable stats card with PNG download, containing only aggregates.
- Contributor guide for local development and PR expectations.
